1. Name the library that is used for database access in Python
2. Name at least 10 additional attributes in Numpy, Panda and Scikit-learn
---
### Library for database access in Python
1. **pyodbc**

   pyodbc is a Python extension that makes accessing ODBC databases simple. It's a database adapter that allows you to connect to ODBC-compliant databases.

   Some popular ODBC-compliant databases include:

- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- IBM DB2
- Microsoft Access

2. **PyDB**

PyDB is a lightweight, database-agnostic Python library that provides a simple, uniform interface for accessing various databases. It supports multiple database backends, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

### 30 Additional Attributes of Numpy are:

1. ndarray: A multi-dimensional array object that is the core of NumPy.

2. dtype: A data type object that describes the type of elements in an array.

3. shape: A tuple that describes the dimensions of an array.

4. size: An integer that represents the total number of elements in an array.

5. reshape(): A method that changes the shape of an array without changing its data.

6. transpose(): A method that swaps the axes of an array.

7. concatenate(): A function that concatenates multiple arrays into a single array.

8. mean(): A function that calculates the mean of an array.

9. median(): A function that calculates the median of an array.

10. std(): A function that calculates the standard deviation of an array.

11. sum(): A function that calculates the sum of an array.

12. min(): A function that finds the minimum value in an array.

13. max(): A function that finds the maximum value in an array.

14. argsort(): A function that returns the indices that would sort an array.

15. random(): A function that generates random numbers.
16. arange(): Creates an array with evenly spaced values within a given range.
17. zeros(): Creates an array filled with zeros.

3. ones(): Creates an array filled with ones.

4. empty(): Creates an empty array.

5. eye(): Creates an identity matrix.

6. linspace(): Creates an array with evenly spaced values over a specified range.

7. meshgrid(): Creates 2D grids of coordinates from one-dimensional arrays.

8. diag(): Creates a diagonal matrix from a one-dimensional array.

9. tri(): Creates an upper or lower triangular matrix.

10. vstack(): Stacks arrays vertically.

11. hstack(): Stacks arrays horizontally.

12. dot(): Computes the dot product of two arrays.

13. cross(): Computes the cross product of two arrays.

14. outer(): Computes the outer product of two arrays.

15. where(): Selects values from two arrays based on a condition.
