### Library for database access in Python
1. **pyodbc**

   pyodbc is a Python extension that makes accessing ODBC databases simple. It's a database adapter that allows you to connect to ODBC-compliant databases.

   Some popular ODBC-compliant databases include:

- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- IBM DB2
- Microsoft Access

2. **PyDB**

PyDB is a lightweight, database-agnostic Python library that provides a simple, uniform interface for accessing various databases. It supports multiple database backends, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle.
